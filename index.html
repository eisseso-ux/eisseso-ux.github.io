          <h2>Artist Bio</h2>

          <!-- EASY EDIT: Replace this paragraph text with your preferred bio. -->
		  <p>Olivia is an artist and creative with a passion for the strange and wonderful. 
			She received a BA in Studio Art from Wheaton College, but has been making, 
			designing, and crafting her entire life. Her skills portfolio is broad and she is always 
			learning new processes. </p>
		<p> She works part time as an artist, taking commissions and selling things 
			you should absolutely go buy on her Etsy shop.
		</p>

		<p>
			In her art she loves balancing the comforting and the creepy. 
			She creates dreams with just a dash of nightmare to keep you grounded 
			(or sometimes the opposite). Themes in Olivia’s work include dreams, the awkwardness 
			and grace of the human body, other-wordly creatures, storytelling and nonsense. She 
			deeply loves people, and uses her art to connect people to each other, the world around 
			them, and most of all themselves. She is constantly looking for ways to use art to serve 
			her community. She firmly believes the act of creating changes people, increasing both 
			vulnerability and resiliency. As such she is always looking to help people discover their 
			artistic capabilities and to show them that have something worthwhile to say. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If this sounds like something you would like to partner with Olivia on, 
			please reach out about commissions or collaborations!
